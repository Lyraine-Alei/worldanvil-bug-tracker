## World Anvil Bug Tracker

This is the public repository to track bugs found in [World Anvil](https://worldanvil.com). 

In order to report an issue you will need a GitHub account. You can use [this](https://github.com/join) link to join. Just follow the instructions!

Use the search function to see if your issue was already reported. If it was then add a comment to the issue instead of making a new one. This might help the team track down the bug faster and increase the priority.

Once you have an account go to the Issues tab above and press the green New Issue button. Follow the instructions of the text and fill in all the necessary information to make it easier to track down the bugs you have encountered.

Make sure to add a meaningful title to the issue to ensure that it can be found easily.

Thank you for your report!
